    <h4>Introduction: How we got here</h4>
    <p>Hi everybody, my name is Joy and I just got laid off from my job two days ago.
    It wasn't much of a surprise; my most recent occupation had been doing customer service
     for an international tour company that, of course, had to scale down in order
     to cope with a dramatic loss of revenue caused by the pandemic. </p>

    <p>  As one might imagine, working customer service in such a situation was less than optimal,
      and as the months went by, I realized that I needed to get out. I wasn't going to quit
      (I felt too scared to do that in this uncertain job climate), but I had begun looking at my options and
      made the decision to continue schooling to get a better opportunity for myself. I had
     finally decided to pursue a more technical career and, no kidding, enrolled in some online night classes
     just the night before I got let go. While those classes were more geared toward analytics, I knew I
     wanted to learn programming and now, with all of this job that I no longer have, I'm going to squeeze out
     as much lemonade as I can.
    </p>
    <p>This log is going to be where I track my progress with
    finding a job and pursuing a new skillset, God willing, leading to a new career.</p>
